# Web to Markdown

A Chrome extension that converts web pages to clean, formatted Markdown with a single click.

## Features

- One-click conversion of web pages to Markdown
- Automatically copies converted Markdown to clipboard
- Cleans up unnecessary HTML elements (scripts, forms, styles)
- Supports GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)
- Preserves links and images with absolute URLs
- Visual feedback for successful/failed conversions

## Installation

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd web-to-markdown
bun install
```

2. Build the extension:

```bash
# One-time build
bun run build

# Or watch mode for development
bun run watch
```

### Loading in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `dist` directory from your project folder

The extension icon should now appear in your Chrome toolbar!

### Development Workflow

1. Make changes to files in the `src` directory
2. Run `bun run build` (or keep `bun run watch` running)
3. Chrome will automatically reload the extension when `dist` is updated
4. If changes don't appear, click the "Reload" (ðŸ”„) button on the extension card in `chrome://extensions/`
